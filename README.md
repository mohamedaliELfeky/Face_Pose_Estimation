# Face Pose Estimation using x and y feature points extracted using MediaPipe

This project is an implementation of Face Pose Estimation, which uses machine learning algorithms and MediaPipe to extract x and y feature points to estimate the pose of a person's face. The project is designed to track the orientation of a person's head and face in real-time and can be used for face recognition, augmented reality, and gaming.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn


# Installation

1- Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/mohamedaliELfeky/Face_Pose_Estimation.git

```
2- Install the required dependencies:

```bash

pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy scikit-learn

```


# Usage

1- Run the face_pose_estimation.py file to launch the program.


```python
python face_pose_estimation.py
```


2- Once the program is running, position your face in front of the camera, and the program will start detecting your head pose and showing the angles for pitch, yaw, and roll in real-time.
