# Face Pose Estimation using x and y feature points extracted using MediaPipe

This project is an implementation of Face Pose Estimation, which uses machine learning algorithms and MediaPipe to extract x and y feature points to estimate the pose of a person's face. The project is designed to track the orientation of a person's head and face in real-time and can be used for face recognition, augmented reality, and gaming.
